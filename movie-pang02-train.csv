Pos, films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content  
Pos, every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i suppose that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    
Pos, you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
Pos,    jaws   is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen    the movie opens with blackness   and only distant   alien like underwater sounds    then it comes   the first ominous bars of composer john williams  now infamous score    dah dum    from there   director steven spielberg wastes no time   taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly    right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean   and once   jaws   has attacked   it never relinquishes its grip    perhaps what is most outstanding about   jaws   is how spielberg builds the movie    he works it like a theatrical production   with a first act and a second act    unlike so many modern filmmakers   he has a great deal of restraint   and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act    until then   he merely suggests its presence with creepy   subjective underwater shots and williams  music    he s building the tension bit by bit   so when it comes time for the climax   the shark s arrival is truly terrifying    he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery    the first act opens with police chief martin brody   roy scheider     a new york cop who has taken an easy   peaceful job running the police station on amity island   a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years    the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july   and the mayor   larry vaughn   murray hamilton     doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money    brody is joined by matt hooper   richard dreyfuss     a young   ambitious shark expert from the marine institute    hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it    his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark     it s a perfect engine   an eating machine     make it that much more terrifying    when vaughn finally relents   hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint   robert shaw   on his decrepit boat   the orca   to search for the shark    the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark   and inevitably   are hunted by it       jaws   is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing   tension   and horror    it is like ten movies all rolled into one   and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time   until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by   star wars        even today   fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s   psycho     and it never seems to age    although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences   including several mechanical sharks   obsolete   none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill    the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing   characterization   sharp editing   and creative photography   instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects    scheider   dreyfuss   and shaw were known actors at the time   jaws   was made   but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman    nevertheless   this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark    scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town       it s your first summer here   you know     mayor vaughn warns him    dreyfuss   who had previously been seen in   american graffiti     1973   and   the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     1974   gives a surprisingly mature   complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers    however   most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab   a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards    bordering of parody   shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism    he s slightly deranged   and shaw s performance is almost a caricature    however   there is one scene late in the film   when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars    quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u   s   s    indianapolis   a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese    his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1   000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen    shaw delivers the story in one long take   and it is the best acting in the film    of course   we can t leave out the shark itself   with its black eyes   endless rows of teeth   and insatiable urge to eat   it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature    a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real    having survived sinch the dinosaurs   great whites do exist   they can be as large as the shark in   jaws     and they are a threat    every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark   a bunch of writihing   dangling   completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into    the shark in   jaws   was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks   all nicknamed   bruce   by the crew   built to be shot from different angles    many have forgotten   but   jaws   was a sort of precursor to   waterworld     1995     a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb    but   as we can see now   spielberg overcame all the obstacles   and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood    
Pos, moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era    you ve got to know how to allocate your resources    every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers    in the nfl   this leads to teams like the detroit lions   who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract   but can only field five guys named herb to block for him    in the movies   you end up with films like   spawn     with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors    jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking    he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line    watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid   fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars   is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit   except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages    but like the lions star   jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him    almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts   and as chan does his own stunts   the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills    this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors   chan directs     scripts and dubbing and supporting characters   not to mention the hideous title sequence    this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain       chan s first release in this country     rumble in the bronx     was supposedly set in new york   but was filmed in vancouver   and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible      heck   jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut   looks like   much less a personal hairstylist    in condor   chan plays the same character he s always played   himself   a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen   a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu    jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert   and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs   one of the things i like about jackie chan movies   no political correctness      he is joined by three women   who have little to do except scream     jackie   save us !     and misuse firearms    the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere   and he s more pathetic than evil    en route   we have an extended motorcycle chase scene   a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazis   and two confrontations with savage natives    once at the secret desert base   there is a long chop socky sequence   followed by the film s centerpiece   a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face/off    this is where the money was spent   on well choreographed kung fu sequences   on giant kevlar hamster balls   on smashed up crates of bananas   and on scorpions    ignore the gaping holes in the plot   how   exactly   if the villain s legs were broken   did he escape from the secret nazi base   and why didn t he take the key with him        don t worry about the production values   or what   exactly   the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara    just go see the movie    operation condor has pretentions of being a   raiders of the lost ark   knockoff   but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him    with a lawrence kazdan screenplay   a john williams score   spielberg directing and george lucas producing   condor might be an a+ movie    however   you ve got to go with what you ve got   and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special    a talent that mainstream hollywood should   could   and ought to utilize    
Pos, i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan    i ve seen some of his films   silkwood   backdraft   unlawful entry   and while he gave adequate performances   i have never been impressed with his work    breakdown   then   is something of a surprise    russell gives a fine performance   as do most of the cast   one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film    to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true   but he does it no harm    russell plays jeff   one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy   kathleen quinlan   cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life    while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and   left helpless and stranded   jeff waves down a passing truck driver   j   t    walsh   who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck    because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians   jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help    that   it seems   is the last time jeff   or anyone else   sees her    breakdown has been compared to several movies   george sluizer s the vanishing   the original   hopefully   not his appalling hollywood remake     steven spielberg s duel and any number of hitchcock films    as with these   breakdown does not   for the most part   stray down the conventional path of the american action thriller    jeff does not become a gun toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife   but instead becomes a scared   confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on    when we do find out what has happened to amy   it does come as a slight disappointment   if only because it s too early in the film   i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment   but this affects the film little    russell   as mentioned earlier   is very good in his role   and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13    j   t    walsh   as the possibly evil truck driver   is terrific   he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn t seem to know what to do with   but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here    the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person   one anyone would be able to trust   which makes the plot that much more believable    breakdown is what hollywood doesn t make enough of   a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do   indeed   have viewers on the edge of their seats    one of the most genuinely exciting films i ve seen in a long time    
Pos, with the success of the surprise hit alien   directed by ridley scott   a sequel was inevitable    in fact   after watching the first film   a sequel was wanted   particularly by this reviewer    handing over the director s chair to recent box office gem james cameron   who had only made two films previous to this one   pirahna ii   a surprisingly dull film   and terminator   making cameron a household name     the alien series got a face lift of immense proportions    instead of being a suspense/science fiction film   cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture    what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created    a film like aliens comes along only once in a while   and when it does   audiences are usually unprepared for it    i never saw this movie in theaters   but i wish i could have    the terror and fright must have been unimaginable   most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear    aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen    with a science fiction plot   cameron gives aliens added testosterone   pumping up the action and fire power from the original film    in fact   aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original    perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero  or heroine   as the case may be    never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film   and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character    sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about    placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual   but because of weaver s presence   a woman is the only suitable hero    aliens begins 57 years after alien ended    lieutenant ellen ripley   weaver   is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened    she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens   but   the company   is doubtful    they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left    despite stern warnings from ripley   the company remains rigid and won t call the families back    however   when the company loses contact with the colony   ripley s story seems much more feasible    one of the company s directors   carter burke   paul reiser     wants to gather a team to travel to the planet    this team includes a buff private vasquez   jenette goldstein     a questionable corporal hicks   michael biehn     and a loyal android bishop   lance henriksen      burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony    arriving on the planet   the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon type environment    the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca   newt   jorden   carrie henn      ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become   and she becomes newt s surrogate mother    ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened   and soon   all hell breaks loose    aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott s version   it also multiplies the number of aliens in general    alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member   except ripley   who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo    aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens   and as a result   the chills are incredibly heightened    then again   this is james cameron   the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2   judgment day    he is the best action director out there   topping renny harlin   who directed cliffhanger     and only he could create something as terrifying as this film    it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes   and aliens has the motherload    with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film   aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion    i can t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout   never dropping for a moment    just when you think the movie is over   something else will occur   and it starts right back up again    with a seemingly endless conclusion   aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history    this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film   as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen    using flawless special effects   the climax is exhausting   leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety    of course   for a film of this genre to work properly   the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see    aliens is completely realistic   even a decade after its initial release    the special effects are wonderfully seamless   with a terrifying alien to go with them    one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music   composed by cameron regular james horner    horner has created a terrific score   receiving an oscar nomination for his work    not only that   horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film   or science fiction film ever   and that includes 2001   a space odyssey   which was mainly a compilation of well known composers      in fact   the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music    the production design is incredible   which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy    dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive   but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations    normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer   aliens uses lights to scare the viewer    then   of course   is the cinematography   which uses point of view shots   along with video feeds in order to build suspense    some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley    surprisingly   the acting is not only above average for this genre   but some of the best    sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley   incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona    weaver soars above the rest in this film   but she is supposed to    carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child   developing a three dimensional character from her quiet attitude    lance henriksen is terrific as bishop   showing that androids don t always have to be flat characters    jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role   and steals several scenes of her own   though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn t fighting      michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film    however   biehn does a good job   making it seem original again    paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director   but reiser manages to pull it off quite well   however   i still see him as paul on tv s   mad about you        a very good cast   which also includes bill paxton and william hope   highlights this action film   making it stand out from others    aliens is rightfully rated r for violence   gore   language   and terror    aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre   as alien was more of a suspense/horror film    aliens pumps up the stakes   and cameron directs it with professional quality    cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film   but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen    technically astonishing   aliens  only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed    aside from this   you probably won t experience anything like aliens for quite a while    
Pos, ingredients   neophyte lawyer   legal situations   corrupt insurance company    synopsis   rudy baylor   matt damon   is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time    rudy s girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband   rudy s elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded   and   the family of rudy s friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn t pay for a bone marrow transplant    rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned   but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser   danny devito   who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge   danny glover      jon voight plays leo f   drummond   the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all powerful insurance company s team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice    will rudy defeat leo    will he enjoy being a lawyer    opinion   the good news is that this movie has a happy ending   and it features a guy trying to do the right thing    director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie    in the typical lawyer movie there s one big case and the movie focuses on solving it   and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins   after lots of gripping courtroom drama      however   coppola s movie is deliberately more low key     the rainmaker  plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters    in the background rudy s voice narrates his feelings and makes half cynical jokes about the legal profession in general    two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be    first   rudy s time is split juggling three cases   rather than concentrating on a single high stakes case    also   rudy s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge    the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win   and rudy narrates his way into coming of age    
Pos, in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library   casablanca was my third classic in some weeks    the others being citizen kane and vertigo   yes   i am trying to see as many of afi s greatest movies ever made as i can      but   casablanca stood out from the rest for me   it was actually watchable    what most hail as the greatest american film ever   casablanca isn t so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in    it seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman    that annoyed me   as did the ending    why didn t the plan turn around   !    surprisingly   i enjoyed the film    i liked bogart s character and his acting   not over the top as most actors in his era      i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie   which one would it be   and a women said casablanca    at first i was thinking to myself   why      then   as i watched the film again   i understood why    the movie is very well done and the script top notch   although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo    casablanca is   in my mind   no classic   like solaris     but it is a good film and stylishly shot    hey   hollywood   how about this   a remake with harrison ford and anne heche    now that would be a classic    
Pos, capsule   suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick   which isn t necessarily a bad thing    not exactly oscar caliber   but one helluva bullet riddled good time    extended review   you know   i remember when hitmen were evil   murderous scum    alas   the times are a changin     in a recent string of movies   hitmen are suddenly wise  cracking   fun loving killers with hearts    this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong s first american feature   the big hit    oddly enough   about the same time last year a similar film   grosse point blank   was released    advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action   it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it    the big hit is quite the opposite    it was hyped as   the new film from producer john woo     so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action    however   there s a sore lack of it   which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit    the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver    mel   played by mark wahlberg in a dopey   milquetoast role   is a killing machine   he flips   spins   even breakdances whilst popping caps    sadly   he doesn t get a chance to do much of it    except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so   the film is in comedy mode    the action   at least what there is of it   is prime cut stuff    wong   after numerous hong kong features   makes quite a nice u   s   debut    however   his pacing is a bit off   with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough    they start off electrifying and fresh   but just kinda stop    normally   this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable    luckily   we have ben ramsey s screenplay   a bitingly funny piece of work    the only problem is there might be too much humor   one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few    some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism    the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled   some being there only for a laugh   which sometimes works   sometimes doesn t    overall   the big hit may have it s flaws   but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed   gut wrenchingly funny joyride    definately one of the better ways to spend two hours    
Neg, there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling   hapless straight man from the hysterical   naked gun   films   crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he s committed himself to starring in since    the wavering movie spoofs   however   are less forgivable    to be fair     wrongfully accused     the send up in question and nielsen s third parody since the last   gun     isn t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his   dracula   dead and loving it   or   spy hard     which is a mighty good thing    nielsen is still in tip top comedic form   able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns   but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them   and he needs one very soon       wrongfully accused   meshes together the premises of   the fugitive   and   patriot games     casting its always game star as ryan harrison   get it       a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress   kelly le brock      she   however   sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband   michael york     a crime actually committed by a one armed   one legged   one eyed man   aaron pearl      harrison is arrested   found guilty and sentenced to death   but escapes from a prison bus   of course   and then is pursued by a determined u   s   marshal named fergus falls   richard crenna   unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones  already smirky oscar winning role      there s also a mystery brunette   melinda mcgraw   and an assassination subplot involving the u   n   secretary general   but like any of it matters       wrongfully accused   gets off to an assured start   with an in concert nielsen   touted   lord of the violin   by bare chested posters   pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage    nice touch    most of the scenes that follow   however   never top the opener       hysterical exceptions   the mentos and   baywatch   goofs      movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate   but most are empty    when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la   anaconda   or baseball players disappear into a   field of dreams    esque cornfield   there s really nothing to laugh at    other moments   like an interlude in a fishing shop   are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at    there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here   so it s possible that director/writer pat proft   by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two   guarantees something is sure to stick    and what does stick sticks well   particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue   what those   naked gun   s   which proft collaborated on   did great   these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember   wrongfully accused   as an almost halfway there spoof instead of a lame brained failure    the movie might have been cursed to begin with   opening fast on the heels of   mafia !     from proft colleague jim abrahams   and   baseketball     from proft colleague david zucker   but it s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing   wrongfully accused   of being nielsen s funniest    
Neg, please don t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam       i  just want to warn all of y all not to waste your hard earned $$$ on anaconda    it s not even worth a 99 cent video rental    don t listen to ebert on this one   he has no clue what he s talking about !    btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment   she reviews movies for a local paper      now i ll actually back up my huffing and puffing    here goes    movie   anaconda rydain s bottom line   wait for it to come on usa up all night    even then   i doubt it s worth the price of jolt   to help you stay up that late !    why do i hate anaconda    let me count the ways        first of all   this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong    as an ophiophile   snake lover     i can tell you that a   anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet   b   they re scared of people   c   cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake s mouth   and constrictor snakes don t kill what they can t eat   d   people can outrun snakes with no trouble   especially heavy ones like anacondas   e   if an anaconda did eat a human   it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal   therefore it couldn t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast   and f   snakes have no vocal cords   so they can t make funny squealing noises    whew    i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it    unfortunately   anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel    my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end    anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually    that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn t give up and fall asleep    he was the most likable character in the movie    who wouldn t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman    anaconda did have its cute moments   arguments between ice cube s character and the british guy   for instance    however   those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty eight minutes of boring schlock    the writers had   and blew   a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines    i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny    did she retort with a clever   ego withering comeback    of course not !     i m trying to work !    gee   that s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with    she could have told him to go find a knothole or something           p but i will admit   there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome   hint   it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks      as for the plot   i m still trying to find one    this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous   computer generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster than gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet       harrier snake      not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims    the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist   should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense     in which the sick guy s g friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him    that was about as clear and understandable as mission   impossible       if someone could explain that movie to me   i d be most grateful !  all the old guy double agents looked the same ! !    i wasn t inspired by the acting   save for the evil dude    i can t blame the actors   though    it s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with    this concludes rydain s diatribe on a shameless exploitation   and perpetuation !   of public fear of snakes    comments   flames   anyone     rydain the atomic cheese   fresh from chernobyl dairies !  
Neg, this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be   one of the hottest writers in hollywood      he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream   8/10     then added the successful i know what you did last summer   7   5/10    script to his mix   and also created the popular tv series   dawson s creek      so when he asked to direct his first movie   based on his first ever script written   everyone and their grandma said   sure   go for it !      uhhm   my question is       did anyone bother reading this stupid script        plot   ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west   mrs   tingle   and set to lose her scholarship to college    when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story   they end up tying her up   and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman    critique   it s not so much that this is a bad movie   than the fact that it sucks    this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters   contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on   zero tension or thrills   plot holes the size of my big ass   lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie   and molly ringwald   vivica a   fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles    i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery   8/10   and 9 to 5   but unfortunately for williamson   he went nowhere with the bright foundation   making references to the exorcist and dr    zhivago   which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate    he also forgot about suspense   with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions   unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue    sure   katie holmes is cute   and her co star   marisa coughlan   did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist   worth two points out of my three on ten     but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film   holmes  rival in the film   mrs   tingle s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her   are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays     and a transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude   hired to be the poor man s version of skeet ulrich   who himself is a poor man s version of johnny depp !      all in all   this movie was laughable for me   provided me with no insight into anything   demonstrated williamson s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script   and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into   unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability   humanity or capacity to comprehend    no hip lines   no cheap thrills   just a dull time at the movie theater    if you want to see a funny teenage movie   go see detroit rock city   8/10     and thank my drunken   sorry ass in the morning    little known facts about this film and its stars   kevin williamson s father was a fisherman    kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer   7   5/10      he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally   so is dawson leery on tv s   dawson s creek     a show kevin created    he was once an aspiring actor    in fact   he even landed a bit part on tv s   another world      also   williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs   tingle   which is also loosely based on the book   killing mr   griffin   by the writer of i know what you did last summer   7   5/10      lois duncan    he has also come out and said that he is a gay man    helen mirren was born in london   england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff    she is married to director taylor hackford   whose works include devil s advocate   8/10   and an officer and a gentleman   8   5/10      this film was originally titled killing mrs    tingle   but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident    actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called   wasteland      this is actor barry watson first full feature film    he has played the character of   seth   on tv s   malibu shores   several times    
Neg, in a typical cinematic high school   the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them   but not before the boys  scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books    as the sexual acts take place   the other guys hang out nearby   guzzling beer and grunting like pigs    in the rage   carrie 2   robert mandel s terminally bland sequel to carrie   there isn t a single original moment    only amy irving returns from carrie   and the talent of the rest of the sequel s cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu s script    as rachel   the horror story s lead   emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory   but it isn t exactly her fault    the director asks for little from his actors   which is precisely what he gets    sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie   rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open   but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim    her fellow students delight in tormenting her    of course   she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers    as the movie marks time until its big finale   it throws in some repugnant scenes   hoping to turn audience s stomachs    rachel s girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made   love   to her the night before spurns her       he gets major points in his black book for this   but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death      even a helpless puppy is run over   and we see his poor   little body flipping over and over under a truck    the teenagers in the movie are completely blas   about it all       doesn t it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday     asks one of the few kids with a conscience       why      responds his nonplussed girlfriend       she wasn t anybody      remarkably devoid of any energy   especially for a horror flick   the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater s armrest    with material this bad   the film s only hope is to go for parody   but it isn t smart enough to realize it    even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie    the rage   carrie 2 runs 1   45    it is rated r for graphic violence   teen alcohol abuse   sex   nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers    
Neg, man   this was one wierd movie    similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn t decide which genre it is    the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone   which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship    the last half hour    this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided     screw it   let s just kill everybody      from then on   forget sci fi       this  movie becomes 100% horror    what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way    instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare   this movie just uses loud noises   sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore           yawn         everyone s  seen it all before and knows when to expect it    the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew    there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed   but what did this    then finally after being painfully restored   the new crew views the video    the acting isn t too bad at all           considering what the actors had to work with anyway   as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of    there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though   like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space    this movie could have been so much better    it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with    there was just nothing new here that any of us haven t seen before in aliens or hellraiser    
Neg, the king and i   a warner brothers animated   musical feature   recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king   with obvious results    when anna   miranda richardson     a british schoolteacher   travels to saim to educate the king s   martin vidnovic   children   she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly   and must say something to the greedy ruler    meanwhile   the king s prime minister   ian richardson     the stereotypical villain   plots to overthrow the king   taking the throne    the last   and most predictable   main subplot deals with the king s son   allen d   hong     and his love for a servant   tuptim   armi arabe     and how he conflicts with his feelings   and the ancient laws of saim    not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent   as the king and i s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal    i will only note the major difficulties   for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail    the screenplay   written by arthur rankin   peter bakalian   jacqeline feather   and david seidler   which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein   has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory   as every time the obnoxious king would shout     etc   etc   etc     i would cringe    literally    speaking of cringing  i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film   which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking    besides the repetitive dialogue from the king   on the whole   the songs seem out of place   and unlike the lyrics   are unmagical    the sole song which is used cleverly is   getting to know you     which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors   which they have never been exposed to    unlike disney animated features   the king and i s songs don t add to the film   and are as uneffective as could be    take the following scenario as an example   as the sheer horror of the king and i s music is at its worst    you re being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do !    sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion  you hear the saying two negatives don t make a positive    believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has   along with his awful voice track   the king is completely unbelievable   only shows mild signs of any personality   and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says   etc     etc     etc       more and more as the film progresses    no personality at the beginning of the movie   none at the end    and where does this character s personality change    hey   i thought anna was supposed to change him !  isn t that the whole plot    the prime minister s hideous sidekick   darrell hammond   brings his share of cringes as well   oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy har har !  he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets   but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him    by the way this review is going   you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films  hence why i hate this movie   because the king and i is a disgrace to animation    animated films   such as 1994 s the lion king and 1998 s the prince of egypt   are among my favorite movies of all time    the animation team does design their share of well animated settings   so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king   until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds    i have not read the play   or seen the oscar winning   1956 film adaption   but from what i can tell   the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play   for the king and i is never magical   nor interesting    if it wasn t for miranda richardson   who voices anna with feeling   the king and i could earn the title     worst movie of the decade      instead   the king and i will just go down as among the year s worst    the bottom line  avoid this movie at all costs    not even young children   the target audience in this film   will enjoy it    not the slightest bit    
Neg, synopsis   cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion    reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style   ayla grows up to become a blond   feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate    comments   allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies    she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner    the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point   the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title    not even her starring role in this turkey   unfortunately   can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese    it s so uniquely bad   a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries   and miserably fails   to be serious   that it s oddly fascinating    the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed   wanting to see how this dud plays out    the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m   auel    to this day   the book possesses a loyal cult following    i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother    i have never read this book   but i sure hope it s 10   000 times better than its film adaptation    if not   then i m at a complete loss to explain its popularity    the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene    a young ayla   looking much like drew barrymore in e   t      tramps about in the woods    with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her   the audience s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered    what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla s mother   a blonde with fur pants       er    leggings      tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera       well    as the earthquake slowly recedes    a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch   but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven    i won t detail the story any further   this seems enough to illustrate my point    this movie is really stupid    it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief    also   the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston    the movie doesn t just suggest this message   it whacks the message into the audience with a two by four    a blond   gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs    she s of the   new people     they re of the   old people   with   the memories      yep    we get it    we get it    the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up   which surprises me    the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously   but much of it is unconvincing    as stated before   daryl hannah is daryl hannah here   she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time    the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt    the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind    this movie also suffers from its new age trappings    maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985   but now it sounds dated and cliched   like poorly conceived elevator music    add to this the film s faux mysticism   including spirit animals and dream visions   and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you d expect to hear on a 1 900 number   and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious    the clan of the cave bear is rated r   though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ve seen in quite a while    it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity    the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes    the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear    the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about    although this may sound gratuitous   i m sure   it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people    the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie    however   as i wrote at the beginning of this review   it does have the distinction of originality    typically when i think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man   fantasy movies involving dinosaurs   who did not exist at the same time as man   and raquel welch come to mind    the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that   though it s so bad   the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie   which is why i awarded this turkey two stars      i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version   however   i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie    i shudder to think that it could be otherwise        
Neg, salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets    actors who demand such salaries might be greedy   but in some instances they are quite justified   because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation    proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies   and one fine example is breakaway   1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring   in   famous figure skater tonya harding    face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie s poster   but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra   attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster    one day she decides to retire   but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that    realising that her life suddenly became worthless   myra starts running for her life   followed by professional assassins    terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater    although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities   her acting leaves much to be desired    on the other hand   her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality   believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b films a bad name    martin sheen s brother joe estevez   whose character looks like he had entered from another movies  set   is the only bright spot of breakaway    unfortunately   he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding s silver screen debut proved to be her last film    
Neg, movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know !    they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back !    yessssss !    so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it !    we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her !    then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes !    i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable !    imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script !        the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i suppose she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents    
Neg, if anything     stigmata   should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another    of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year   it is clearly the worst    i suppose i should have seen this coming    after all     blair witch   thoroughly creeped me out     sixth sense   was mildly spooky   and then   stir of echoes   had its moments   but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over    clearly   the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping    is it then any surprise that   stigmata   is the dullest   most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while    no   not really    patricia arquette plays frankie page   a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe trotting mother    as it turns out   the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest    the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan   gabriel byrne   because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue    father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs   but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue    his investigation is soon called off   however   when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata   in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ    father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie  s story   considering she s an atheist   but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself   he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on    he eventually begins to suspect that his boss   cardinal houseman   jonathan pryce     is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church    as it turns out   the dead priest had been working on the translation of a   fifth gospel   before they were excommunicated    the new rupert wainwright music video            i mean film   stigmata   is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse    indeed   it would have been good if it were a music video   because it s only interesting for about five minutes    i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion   double exposure   and extreme close ups   whoaaaaaa ! ! ! !     other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and   yes   he has been to film school    his camera trickery is interesting for a little while   but eventually   it becomes headache inducing    what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue   such as it is     with wainwright screaming at the audience     see    look at what i can do !  i m an ex cellent dir ect or      maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse   or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying   ooh   scary !      if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery   i didn t see it    just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story   here comes a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            then again   the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if   stigmata   had a story or characters that were remotely engaging    though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help   he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script    where are plot continuity and character development when you need them    case in point   frankie page is the character that   i assume   we are supposed to identify and sympathize with   but we aren t given any back story on her character   or any reason to like her    the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser   who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building   and she s kind of cute   so let s start the bleeding !  the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help   either    according to frankie page   what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back    go clubbing !  sure   that makes sense    arquette   byrne   and pryce give it the old college try   but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking    scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable    even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes   she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon    even more curiously   he seems to be interested in her advances    father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic    as for pryce   he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle     i ll get you   my pretty     for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded    trust me   i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain    what s worse   after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats   we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction   veers off in another   then another   and ends up being totally incomprehensible    first of all   the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details   how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary    how come an atheist like her was chosen   since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata    actually   i m not sure what frankie was posessed by    supposedly   stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit   but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest   and later by some evil spirit   i think      which one is it    the answer to this question   of course   is very simple   the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr   wainwright wants to use this time    furthermore   the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up   and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church    if you do any research at all about the gospel of st   thomas   you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church   as the film seems to claim     but that it is readily available at your local library    there s nothing the catholics need to worry about   though       stigmata s   religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church    if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters   they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns   which would have been far more interesting    i m not catholic   in fact   i don  t care much for the catholic church   but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means    it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as   stigmata   does    it  s not thought provoking   though it would like to be   and it is definitely not scary   though it pretends to be    i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film   because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story    maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever    the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over   and over   and over    like so many films of the mtv generation   this one suffers from overkill    so much is overdone in   stigmata     that it eventually has no effect on the audience   leaving us to pick out the film s   many   flaws    i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st   thomas is so earth shattering    when we finally hear it   the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school   which means that for all its flash   the whole film is really much ado about nothing    the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog   and   stigmata   is it
