Neg, john boorman s   zardoz   is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own    not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d   wood jr   has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time    of course   wood s career can be explained by two things   he had no money and he had no talent    boorman   on the other hand   cannot court such excuses to explain   zardoz     or his follow up film   the equally awful   exorcist ii   the heretic        boorman obviously had a sizable budget   a matinee idol movie star   sean connery   in the lead role   and although you wouldn t know it from this film   boorman does indeed have talent    this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece   deliverance     1972     as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama   hope and glory     1987     the slightly over conceived arthurian epic   excalibur     1981   and the father son jungle adventure   the emerald forest     1985      his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination   but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste    if boorman is anything   he s ambitious   and when he succeeds   it s in grand fashion    unfortunately   the bigger they are   the harder they fall   and when boorman falls   the resounding impact can be heard for miles around       zardoz   is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies   an obsession of boorman s    his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even   the wizard of oz     a book which figures into the movie s plot    but   despite all this reaching   the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling    the events take place in the distant year 2293   but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found    in fact   things seems to have moved backwards   with people riding horses   shooting old style guns   and living in large victorian mansions    it s more middle ages than space age    the world of   zardoz   is divided into two distinct hemispheres   the outlands   where all the poor   pathetic people live   and the vortex   where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life    these immortals never grow old   they never engage in sexual activity   they possess psychological powers   and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal   and everyone contributes equally to the society    however   if one breaks the rules   that person is punished by being aged so many years    if someone breaks the rules enough   he or she is aged to the point of senility   and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals    one of the immortals   arthur frayn   niall buggy     a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face   is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed    like   the wizard of oz     he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head       this flying head is one of the movie s opening images   and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come      calling himself zardoz   frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators   whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources    from inside his giant   stone head   zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like     the gun is good    the penis is evil      that line alone is worth the movie s cult following    one day   an exterminator named zed   sean connery     sneaks into zardoz s flying stone   pushes frayn out   and goes back to the vortex    once there   the immortals label him a   brutal   and study him like a lab rat   taking great   perverse care in exploring his sexuality   which is a mystery to them    they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection   and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up    i say   hilarious   because that is exactly what   zardoz   is    it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so   he made this film with the straightest of faces   although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward   he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming    just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles   he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper   a mane of hair braided halfway down his back   a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache   and a pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker    boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of   deliverance     which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort    he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera   including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth     2001       whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in   zardoz   besides the inadvertent humor    sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971   and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace    he got exactly that in   zardoz     and it s a wonder it didn t end his career    i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements    is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life    is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing    or is it a social statement   something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates    karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary    come to think of it   maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip    people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy    
Neg, the kids in the hall are an acquired taste    it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer    maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies   they would grow into the big screen    my recommendation is that   unless you are a big fan of the kids   skip the film    as it is   their first  and most likely only  attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv    a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show    the kids go through the motions   but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so    and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics    brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression    in typical sketch comedy tradition   each actor plays several roles    doctor cooper   kevin mcdonald   and his team create the drug    then   under pressure from don roritor   mark mckinney     founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals   dr   cooper releases the drug into the marketplace    the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film    at about 90 minutes   brain candy still seems long    the best thing about sketch comedy  and the kids are no exception  is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs   then go on to another quick skit    but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer   coherent story   the laughs just dont come fast enough    strangely   the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv    the movie makes several attempts at risqueness  mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters  but they seem almost forced   as if they have to live up to a pg rating    one of the best bits   though   does make use of thompsons naked buttocks   we see him charging into battle  going to have sex with some guys taking a shower    in the classic of this genre   monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail    the kids   unfortunately   are not up to the task    there are some amusing moments   to be sure   but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one    
Neg, there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    
Neg, two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit   what is love      while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub    it s barely enough to sustain a three minute  saturday night live  skit   but  snl  producer lorne michaels    clueless  creator amy heckerling   and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring   roxbury guys   sketch that would presumably make a good feature    emphasis on the word   presumably       a night at the roxbury  takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point  and that of viewers  patience levels    the first five minutes or so of  roxbury  play very much like one of the original   roxbury guys   skits    with   what is love      blaring on the soundtrack   the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi   chris kattan and will ferrell   bob their heads   scope out   hotties   at clubs   and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts    there is one crucial difference   however  these guys speak    that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence   that the butabis  newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters    the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren   ferrell   and kattan are new   that s for sure   but they all lead to comic dead ends    there is no story per se   only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots    the brothers literally run into   or   rather   get run into   as in by car   richard grieco of  21 jump street  fame   and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club    there   they meet a hotshot club owner   chazz palminteri   conspicuously uncredited  can you blame him       who takes an interest in an idea of theirs    meanwhile   the bros  overbearing father   dan hedaya   wants them to stop clubbing    when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father   a rift is created between the two    the narrative messiness of  roxbury  would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny   but virtually none of it is    the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film   with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end    alas   the joke  a rather lazy takeoff on  jerry maguire   will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film    granted   a lot of people  have  seen  jerry maguire    but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about  roxbury  s lack of inspiration    that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves    like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of  saturday night live      the roxbury guys   is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context    after watching one of the   roxbury   skits on snl   this is what you come away with from the characters   they bob their heads to   what is love        bump unsuspecting women   and       that s all    after watching  a night at the roxbury    you ll be left with exactly the same
