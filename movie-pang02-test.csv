Pos, films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content  
Pos, every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i suppose that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    
Pos, you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
Neg, the kids in the hall are an acquired taste    it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer    maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies   they would grow into the big screen    my recommendation is that   unless you are a big fan of the kids   skip the film    as it is   their first  and most likely only  attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv    a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show    the kids go through the motions   but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so    and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics    brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression    in typical sketch comedy tradition   each actor plays several roles    doctor cooper   kevin mcdonald   and his team create the drug    then   under pressure from don roritor   mark mckinney     founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals   dr   cooper releases the drug into the marketplace    the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film    at about 90 minutes   brain candy still seems long    the best thing about sketch comedy  and the kids are no exception  is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs   then go on to another quick skit    but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer   coherent story   the laughs just dont come fast enough    strangely   the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv    the movie makes several attempts at risqueness  mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters  but they seem almost forced   as if they have to live up to a pg rating    one of the best bits   though   does make use of thompsons naked buttocks   we see him charging into battle  going to have sex with some guys taking a shower    in the classic of this genre   monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail    the kids   unfortunately   are not up to the task    there are some amusing moments   to be sure   but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one    
Neg, there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    
Neg, two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit   what is love      while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub    it s barely enough to sustain a three minute  saturday night live  skit   but  snl  producer lorne michaels    clueless  creator amy heckerling   and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring   roxbury guys   sketch that would presumably make a good feature    emphasis on the word   presumably       a night at the roxbury  takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point  and that of viewers  patience levels    the first five minutes or so of  roxbury  play very much like one of the original   roxbury guys   skits    with   what is love      blaring on the soundtrack   the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi   chris kattan and will ferrell   bob their heads   scope out   hotties   at clubs   and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts    there is one crucial difference   however  these guys speak    that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence   that the butabis  newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters    the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren   ferrell   and kattan are new   that s for sure   but they all lead to comic dead ends    there is no story per se   only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots    the brothers literally run into   or   rather   get run into   as in by car   richard grieco of  21 jump street  fame   and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club    there   they meet a hotshot club owner   chazz palminteri   conspicuously uncredited  can you blame him       who takes an interest in an idea of theirs    meanwhile   the bros  overbearing father   dan hedaya   wants them to stop clubbing    when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father   a rift is created between the two    the narrative messiness of  roxbury  would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny   but virtually none of it is    the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film   with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end    alas   the joke  a rather lazy takeoff on  jerry maguire   will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film    granted   a lot of people  have  seen  jerry maguire    but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about  roxbury  s lack of inspiration    that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves    like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of  saturday night live      the roxbury guys   is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context    after watching one of the   roxbury   skits on snl   this is what you come away with from the characters   they bob their heads to   what is love        bump unsuspecting women   and       that s all    after watching  a night at the roxbury    you ll be left with exactly the same
